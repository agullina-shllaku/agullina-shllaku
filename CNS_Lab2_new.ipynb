        "Neurons represent and transmit information by firing sequences of spikes in response to the inputs they receive. Understanding how the patterns of these spikes depend on the statistics of the input is therefore important for understanding how neurons process information. Highly detailed neuron models, such as the Hudgkin-Huxley model, can explain very well the biophysical mechanism of how the action potentials are generated but they can also be computationally expensive and generally difficult to work with. When studying neural spiking activity and its relation to the input that evoked it, most of the biophysical details can be ignored and the action potential sequence can be characterised simply as a list of times when spikes occurred. This abstraction greatly simplifies neuron models, making them more tractable and allowing to focus on the variables of interest (e.g. the spike patterns).\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the sequence of spikes generated by a given stimulus varies from trial to trial, neuronal responses are typically treated statistically. For example, they may be characterised by *interspike intervals* distributions or *firing rates*, rather than as specific spike sequences. A key feature of neural activity is how this spike frequency *f* changes in response to different synaptic input currents *I* that the neuron receives, and this is described by the *f-I curve*. This function summarises important characteristics of the (*mean*) spiking activity of a neuron and it can be useful as grounds of comparison between neural models and experimental data. To characterise the *stochastic* properties of spiking activity (e.g. how variable spikes are), a useful statistic often used in neuroscience is the *Fano factor*, which measures the variance of a counting process (e.g. spike counts) relative to its mean. Taken together, these quantities characterise the mean and variance of neural activity patterns and allow us to quantify how they change in response to different (or noisy) inputs, which is the basis of neural coding and how neurons trasmit information.\n",

        "In Lab 1, we modeled the passive and active membrane dynamics of neurons, including how action potentials arise from voltage-gated conductances (Hodgkin-Huxley model). While biophysically detailed, such models are computationally expensive and difficult to analyze mathematically. The **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** neuron offers a simpler alternative: it uses the passive membrane equation from Lab 1, but adds a **threshold** and **reset** rule to generate spikes. When the membrane potential reaches a threshold voltage, a spike is recorded and the voltage is instantly reset. This abstraction sacrifices biophysical detail but gains computational efficiency and analytical tractability.\n",
