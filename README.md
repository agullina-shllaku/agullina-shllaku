# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Agullina Shllaku

ðŸŽ“ **Double Major:** Web & Mobile Computing + Economics & Statistics  
ðŸ’¼ **Previous Experiences:** Data Scientist & Automation Developer  
ðŸ§  **Current Obsession:** Applying AI to unravel the mysteries of the brain (aka Neuroscience)  

---

## ðŸš€ What I'm Exploring  
- Building bridges between **Artificial Intelligence** and **Neuroscience** â€” because who says machines and brains can't be best friends?  
- Diving deep into **neural networks**, **machine learning**, and all things cognitive computing.  
- Crafting clever automation tools that save time (because who has time to waste?).

## ðŸŽ¿ Outside the Code  
- Ski enthusiast, I used to race down slopes, chasing adrenaline and the perfect turn.  
- Lover of fresh mountain air, powder days, and maybe the occasional hot chocolate afterward.  
- Believer that a day without laughter (or a good ski run) is a day wasted.
